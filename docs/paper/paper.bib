abstract = {Objective: With modern optimization methods, free optimization of parallel transmit pulses together with their gradient waveforms can be performed on-line within a short time. A toolbox which uses PyTorch's autodifferentiation for simultaneous optimization of RF and gradient waveforms is presented and its performance is evaluated. Methods: MR measurements were performed on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a 3D saturated single-shot turboFlash sequence for B1+ mapping. RF pulse simulation and optimization were done using a Python toolbox and a dedicated server. An RF- and Gradient pulse design toolbox was developed, including a cost function to balance different metrics and respect hardware and regulatory limits. Pulse performance was evaluated in GRE and MPRAGE imaging. Pulses for non-selective and for slab-selective excitation were designed. Results: Universal pulses for non-selective excitation reduced the flip angle error to an NRMSE of (12.3±1.7)% relative to the targeted flip angle in simulations, compared to (42.0±1.4)% in CP mode. The tailored pulses performed best, resulting in a narrow flip angle distribution with NRMSE of (8.2±1.0)%. The tailored pulses could be created in only 66 s, making it feasible to design them during an experiment. A 90° pulse was designed as preparation pulse for a satTFL sequence and achieved a NRMSE of 7.1%. We showed that both MPRAGE and GRE imaging benefited from the pTx pulses created with our toolbox. Conclusion: The pTx pulse design toolbox can freely optimize gradient and pTx RF waveforms in a short time. This allows for tailoring high-quality pulses in just over a minute.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The Vespa package (Versatile Simulation, Pulses, and Analysis) is described and demonstrated. It provides workflows for developing and optimizing linear combination modeling (LCM) fitting for 1H MRS data using intuitive graphical user interface interfaces for RF pulse design, spectral simulation, and MRS data analysis. Command line interfaces for embedding workflows in MR manufacturer platforms and utilities for synthetic dataset creation are included. Complete provenance is maintained for all steps in workflows. Theory and Methods: Vespa is written in Python for compatibility across operating systems. It embeds the PyGAMMA spectral simulation library for spectral simulation. Multiprocessing methods accelerate processing and visualization. Applications use the Vespa database for results storage and cross-application access. Three projects demonstrate pulse, sequence, simulation, and data analysis workflows: (1) short TE semi-LASER single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) LCM fitting, (2) optimizing MEGA-PRESS (MEscher–GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) flip angle and LCM fitting, and (3) creating a synthetic short TE dataset. Results: The LCM workflows for in vivo basis set creation and spectral analysis showed reasonable results for both the short TE semi-LASER and MEGA-PRESS. Examples of pulses, simulations, and data fitting are shown in Vespa application interfaces for various steps to demonstrate the interactive workflow. Conclusion: Vespa provides an efficient and extensible platform for characterizing RF pulses, pulse design, spectral simulation optimization, and automated LCM fitting via an interactive platform. Modular design and command line interface make it easy to embed in other platforms. As open source, it is free to the MRS community for use and extension. Vespa source code and documentation are available through GitHub.},

Furthermore, we explored the use of noise conditioning augmentation (NCA) as an alternative augmentation technique for DDPM-based SR models, but it was found to reduce performance.

   abstract = {Carefully engineered radiofrequency (RF) pulses play a key role in a number of systems such as mobile phone, radar and magnetic resonance imaging. The design of an RF waveform, however, is often posed as an inverse problem with no general solution. As a result, various design methods, each with a specific purpose, have been developed on the basis of the intuition of human experts. In this work we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered RF pulse design framework, DeepRF, which utilizes the self-learning characteristics of deep reinforcement learning to generate a novel RF pulse. The effectiveness of DeepRF is demonstrated using four types of RF pulses that are commonly used. The DeepRF-designed pulses successfully satisfy the design criteria while reporting reduced energy. Analyses demonstrate the pulses utilize new mechanisms of magnetization manipulation, suggesting the potentials of DeepRF in discovering unseen design dimensions beyond human intuition. This work may lay the foundation for an emerging field of AI-driven RF waveform design. Radiofrequency pulses of different shapes can increase the efficiency of applications such as broadcasting or medical imaging, but finding the optimal shape for a specific use can be computationally costly. Shin and colleagues present a new method based on deep reinforcement learning to design radiofrequency pulses for use in MRI, which is demonstrated to cover different types of optimization goals for each application.},

   abstract = {Several methods have been proposed for overcoming the effects of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field inhomogeneity in high-field MRI. Some of these methods rely at least in part on the ability to independently control magnitude and phase of different drives in either one multielement RF coil or in different RF coils in a transmit array. The adjustment of these drive magnitudes and phases alone to create uniform RF magnetic (B1) fields has been called RF shimming, and has certain limits at every frequency as dictated by possible solutions to Maxwell's equations. Here we use numerical calculations to explore the limits of RF shimming in the human head. We found that a 16-element array can effectively shim a single slice at frequencies up to 600 MHz and the whole brain at up to 300 MHz, while an 80-element array can shim the whole brain at up to 600 MHz. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The generation of such pulses either by multiplication of existing radiofrequency pulses by a Dirac comb function or by means of Fourier series expansion is described. Practical schemes for the implementation of such pulses are given, and strategies for optimizing the pulse profile at fixed pulse duration are outlined. The pulses are implemented using a spin-echo sequence. The power deposition is independent of the number of slices acquired, and hence the power deposition per slice is considerably reduced compared to multislice imaging. Excellent image quality is obtained both in phantoms and in images of the human head. These pulses should find widespread application for multiplexed imaging, in particular at high static magnetic field strengths and for pulse sequences that have a high radiofrequency power deposition and could lead to dramatic increases in scanning efficiency.

abstract = {Compressed sensing in magnetic resonance imaging essentially involves the optimization of (1) the sampling pattern in k-space under MR hardware constraints and (2) image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Recently, deep learning methods have allowed the community to address both problems simultaneously, especially in the non-Cartesian acquisition setting. This work aims to contribute to this field by tackling some major concerns in existing approaches. Particularly, current state-of-the-art learning methods seek hardware compliant k-space sampling trajectories by enforcing the hardware constraints through additional penalty terms in the training loss. Through ablation studies, we rather show the benefit of using a projection step to enforce these constraints and demonstrate that the resulting k-space trajectories are more flexible under a projection-based scheme, which results in superior performance in reconstructed image quality. In 2D studies, our novel PROjection for Jointly lEarning non-Cartesian Trajectories while Optimizing Reconstructor (PROJeCTOR) trajectories present an improved image reconstruction quality at a 20-fold acceleration factor on the fastMRI data set with SSIM scores of nearly 0.92–0.95 in our retrospective studies as compared to the corresponding Cartesian reference and also see a 3–4 dB gain in PSNR as compared to earlier state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we extend the algorithm to 3D and by comparing optimization as learning-based projection schemes, we show that data-driven joint learning-based PROJeCTOR trajectories outperform model-based methods such as SPARKLING through a 2 dB gain in PSNR and 0.02 gain in SSIM.},

abstract = {Optimizing k-space sampling trajectories is a promising yet challenging topic for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work proposes to optimize a reconstruction method and sampling trajectories jointly concerning image reconstruction quality in a supervised learning manner. We parameterize trajectories with quadratic B-spline kernels to reduce the number of parameters and apply multi-scale optimization, which may help to avoid sub-optimal local minima. The algorithm includes an efficient non-Cartesian unrolled neural network-based reconstruction and an accurate approximation for backpropagation through the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) operator to accurately reconstruct and back-propagate multi-coil non-Cartesian data. Penalties on slew rate and gradient amplitude enforce hardware constraints. Sampling and reconstruction are trained jointly using large public datasets. To correct for possible eddy-current effects introduced by the curved trajectory, we use a pencil-beam trajectory mapping technique. In both simulations and in- vivo experiments, the learned trajectory demonstrates significantly improved image quality compared to previous model-based and learning-based trajectory optimization methods for 10× acceleration factors. Though trained with neural network-based reconstruction, the proposed trajectory also leads to improved image quality with compressed sensing-based reconstruction.},

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical component of healthcare. MRI data is acquired by playing a series of radio-frequency and magnetic field gradient pulses. Designing these pulse sequences requires knowledge of specific programming environments depending on the vendor hardware (generations) and software (revisions) intended for implementation. This impedes the pace of prototyping. Pulseq (Layton et al., 2017) introduced an open source file standard for pulse sequences that can be deployed on Siemens/GE via TOPPE (Nielsen & Noll, 2018)/Bruker platforms. In this work, we introduce PyPulseq, which enables pulse sequence programming in Python. Its advantages are zero licensing fees and easy integration with deep learning methods developed in Python. PyPulseq is aimed at MRI researchers, faculty, students , and other allied field researchers such as those in neuroscience. We have leveraged this tool for several published research works (Poojar, Geethanath, Reddy, & Venkatesan, n.d.; Ravi et al. Statement of need MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool. It is a critical component of healthcare and has a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment assessment. Structural, functional and metabolic MRI generate valuable information that aid in the accurate diagnosis of a wide range of pathologies. A unique strength of MRI is the ability to visualise diverse pathologies achieved by the flexibility in designing tailored pulse sequences. MRI pulse sequences are a collection of radio-frequency and gradient waveforms that are executed on the scanner hardware to acquire raw data. Research efforts on pulse sequence design are directed at achieving faster scan times, improving tissue contrast and increasing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). However, designing pulse sequences requires knowledge of specific programming environments depending on the vendor hardware (generations) and software (revisions) intended for implementation. Typically, MRI researchers program and simulate the pulse sequences on computers and execute them on MRI scanners. This typically involves considerable effort, impeding the pace of proto-typing and therefore research and development. This also hampers multi-site multi-vendor studies as it requires researchers to be acquainted with each vendor's programming environment. Furthermore, harmonizing acquisition across MRI vendors will enable reproducible research. This work introduces an open source tool that enables pulse sequence programming for Siemens/GE/Bruker platforms in Python, based on the Pulseq standard (Layton et al., 2017).},

However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

@article{Grissom2006,
abstract = {Parallel excitation has been introduced as a means of accelerating multidimensional, spatially-selective excitation using multiple transmit coils, each driven by a unique RF pulse. Previous approaches to RF pulse design in parallel excitation were either formulated in the frequency domain or restricted to echo-planar trajectories, or both. This paper presents an approach that is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem in the spatial domain and allows the use of arbitrary k-space trajectories. Compared to frequency domain approaches, the new design method has some important advantages. It allows for the specification of a region of interest (ROI), which improves excitation accuracy at high speedup factors. It allows for magnetic field inhomogeneity compensation during excitation. Regularization may be used to control integrated and peak pulse power. The effects of Bloch equation nonlinearity on the large-tip-angle excitation error of RF pulses designed with the method are investigated, and the utility of Tikhonov regularization in mitigating this error is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Pruessmann,
abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

@article{Layton2017,
abstract = {Purpose: Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or sequences, often involves extensive programming on vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for example, at different field strengths. This work presents an alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent, open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. Methods: A novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence. Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware. Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for comparison between real and virtual experiments. Results: Minimal effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the approach. Conclusion: A high-level, flexible and hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine scanning although this would be possible with deeper integration into existing workflows.

@article{Stocker2010,
abstract = {A new open-source software project is presented, JEMRIS, the J{\"{u}}lich Extensible MRI Simulator, which provides an MRI sequence development and simulation environment for the MRI community. The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important offresonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose: An automated algorithm for generating realizable MR gradient and shim coil layouts based on the boundary element method is presented here. The overall goal is to reduce postprocessing effort and thus enable for rapid prototyping of new coil designs. For a given surface mesh and target field, the algorithm generates a connected, non-overlapping wire path. Methods: The proposed algorithm consists of several steps: Stream function optimization, two-dimensional surface projection, potential discretization, topological contour sorting, opening and interconnecting contours, and finally adding non-overlapping return paths. Several technical parameters such as current strength, inductance and field accuracy are assessed for quality control. Results: The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in four different examples. All exemplary results demonstrate high accuracy with regard to reaching the respective target field. The optimal discretization for a given stream function is found by generating multiple layouts while varying the input parameter values. Conclusion: The presented algorithm allows for a rapid generation of interconnected coil layouts with high flexibility and low discretization error. This enables to reduce the overall post-processing effort. The source code of this work is publicly available (https://github.com/Philipp-MR/CoilGen).},

@article{Martin2022,
abstract = {Purpose: To perform B + 1-selective excitation using the Bloch-Siegert shift for spatial localization. Theory and Methods: A B + 1-selective excitation is produced by an radiofre-quency (RF) pulse consisting of two summed component pulses: an off-resonant pulse that induces a B + 1-dependent Bloch-Siegert frequency shift and a frequency-selective excitation pulse. The passband of the pulse can be tailored by adjusting the frequency content of the frequency-selective pulse, as in conventional B 0 gradient-localized excitation. Fine magnetization profile control is achieved by using the Shinnar-Le Roux algorithm to design the frequency-selective excitation pulse. Simulations analyzed the pulses' robust-ness to off-resonance, their suitability for multi-echo spin echo pulse sequences, and how their performance compares to that of rotating-frame selective excita-tion pulses. The pulses were evaluated experimentally on a 47.5 mT MRI scanner using an RF gradient transmit coil. Multiphoton resonances produced by the pulses were characterized and their distribution across B + 1 predicted. Results: With correction for varying B + 1 across the desired profile, the proposed pulses produced selective excitation with the specified profile characteristics. The pulses were robust against off-resonance and RF amplifier distortion, and suitable for multi-echo pulse sequences. Experimental profiles closely matched simulated patterns. Conclusion: The Bloch-Siegert shift can be used to perform B 0-gradient-free selective excitation, enabling the excitation of slices or slabs in RF gradient-encoded MRI.},
